# ACE-Data-Scientice

This repo will be the footsteps of my machine learning study progress.

I will share my study notes here, the topics range across fundamental summary, Ml system design, NLP, deep learning, big data (spark), probablity and statistical summaries will also be covered since they are the core of ML algorithms. 

To practice the principle of "learn enough", I will get hands-on projects while learning, theoritical studying will be revisited regularly through industrial project solving. 


Withought further ado, let's do it.

## Machine Learning System Design
